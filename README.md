# Linear Regression
Performing **regression** of several degrees on the following data points, which were affected by **white** and **Poisson noise**. Additionally, studying its **MSE loss** and **bias-variance trade-off**.

$X = np.arange(-10,10,0.2)$

$Y = 2cos(X)/-\pi+(2x)/(2\pi)+2\times cos(3x)/(-3\pi)$
